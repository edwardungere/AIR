## Cloud Ingestion & Response (IR) Lab 

The Cloud Ingestion-Response lab demonstrates a full cloud security monitoring and automated incident response pipline using **AWS** and **Splunk**. Instead of responding to threats from a single telemetry source, IR Lab shows how cloud API logs, network flow metadata, and host-based logs can be correlated together to provide a clear view of adversary tactics and tactics to provide automated and effecient mediations.

The scenario involves a previously compromised a cloud workload operating within the same AWS account as the victim instance; a common real-world initial access scenario.
