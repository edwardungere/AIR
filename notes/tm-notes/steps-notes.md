### 4. Identify vulnerabilities:
- Potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited
- Example: insufficient input validation

### 5. Analyze risk:
- Potential impact and likelihood
- Ease of exploitation
- Potential damage
- Existing controls

### 6. Prioritize and mitigate risks:
- Sort the risks by the impact and potential likelihood
- Determine appropriate countermeasures such as security controls to reduce identified risks
- Enhancing access control
- Security testing
- Monitoring and detection systems
